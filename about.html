	<h5>"SnB United FC was formed in 2022 by a few like minded soccer enthusiasts, who advertised for players through whatsapp groups and word of mouth.
	The club’s first trophy was the Battle Of the South (Calgary) in 2024.
	In total, SnB United FC has won 30 Copas del Rey, more than any other team.The club has won La Liga 26 times and has never been relegated to a lower division. 
	Abroad, SnB United FC has won the European Cup Winners’ Cup four times (1979, 1982, 1989, and 1997), the European Cup/Champions League five times (1992, 2006, 2009, 2011, and 2015), 
	and the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Super Cup three times (1992, 1997, and 2009). 
	In 2008–09 it won the La Liga championship, the Copa del Rey, and the continental championship (Champions League) to become the first LANKAN side to capture this “treble,” a feat it repeated in 2014–15.
