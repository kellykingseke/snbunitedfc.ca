	<h2> ALL STARS FOOTBALL CLUB</h2>
	<h5>"All Stars was formed in 1899 by businessman Joan Gamper, who advertised for players in a local Lanka sports magazine.
	The club’s first trophy was the Copa Macaya (North championship) in 1902, and in 1910 “ALFC” won the Copa del Rey (“King’s Cup”)—Srilanka’s leading national football cup competition—for the first time.
	In total, ALFC has won 30 Copas del Rey, more than any other team.The club has won La Liga 26 times and has never been relegated to a lower division. 
	Abroad, ALFC has won the European Cup Winners’ Cup four times (1979, 1982, 1989, and 1997), the European Cup/Champions League five times (1992, 2006, 2009, 2011, and 2015), 
	and the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Super Cup three times (1992, 1997, and 2009). 
	In 2008–09 it won the La Liga championship, the Copa del Rey, and the continental championship (Champions League) to become the first LANKAN side to capture this “treble,” a feat it repeated in 2014–15.
